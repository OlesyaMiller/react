#Book-Notes


##Description
This is an app for all book lovers to come to and keep track of their notes on books.
It is an excellent resource for any students who need to read a book for their class
and need a place to track their thoughts and notes.

This is the API side of the app Book Notes. You'll need to have this running for the client side to work. The client repository can be found [here!](https://github.com/aisayo/react)

  ## Getting Started

  Please make sure you have Ruby and Rails set up in your environment.

  To get the API running, please run `rails s -p 3000`. If you just run `rails s` please make sure that the client side is running on a different port and not p 3000. The client side will run on p 3001
